# MESSENGER Missing Bow Shock Crossings

For particularly low Alfenic Mach numbers, we expect Mercury's bow shock to disappear. [ Bowers et al. (in prep, 2024)] . We know the period of MESSENGER's orbit, and can hence determine if there are times in the crossings file where we expect a crossing, but there isn't.

We can do this by determining the time between each crossing (of the same type) and the next, and seeing if there are values outside of what is expected.
